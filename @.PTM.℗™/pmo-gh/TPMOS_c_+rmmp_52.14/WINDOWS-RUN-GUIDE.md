## The Problem: .+x File Extension

On Linux, files with `.+x` extension are executed directly because the shell doesn't care about extensions.

On Windows, the `.+x` extension is **not recognized**, so you get a dialog asking "How do you want to open this file?"

## Solution: Use cmd.exe /c with Full Paths

All provided batch scripts now use this pattern:

```batch
cmd.exe /c "C:\full\path\to\binary.+x"
```

This works because `cmd.exe /c` executes the file directly without needing a file association.

## Quick Start

### Test GL-OS Desktop (OpenGL) - WORKING ✓

```cmd
.\win_debug.bat
```

This opens an OpenGL window with the GL-OS desktop.

### Test Full CHTPM Pipeline

```cmd
.\run_chtpm_debug.bat
```

This shows what's being launched and starts the orchestrator.

### Standard Launch

```cmd
.\run_chtpm.bat
```

Clean launch without debug output.

## Optional: Register .+x Extension

If you want to run `.+x` files directly without wrappers:

```cmd
.\register_plus_x.bat
```

**Requires Administrator privileges.** This registers `. +x` as an executable file type system-wide.

After registration, you can run:

```cmd
.\pieces\chtpm\plugins\+x\orchestrator.+x
```

directly from any command prompt.

## How The System Works

The CHTPM+OS runtime follows this pipeline:

1. **orchestrator.+x** starts and spawns child processes:
   - **renderer.+x** - Reads `current_frame.txt` and displays it
   - **gl_renderer.+x** - OpenGL renderer (if enabled)
   - **clock_daemon.+x** - Updates game time
   - **chtpm_parser.+x** - Parses layouts, handles input
   - **response_handler.+x** - Handles system responses
   - **joystick_input.+x** - Gamepad support

2. **Keyboard input** goes to `pieces/keyboard/history.txt`

3. **chtpm_parser** reads input, updates layout, writes to `pieces/display/current_frame.txt`

4. **renderer** reads `current_frame.txt` and prints to console

5. **GL renderer** (if running) shows OpenGL window with same content

## Troubleshooting

### "This command cannot be run completely"

Make sure you're using the batch wrappers (`win_debug.bat`, etc.) which use `cmd.exe /c` with full paths.

### "File not found"

Run `compile_all.ps1` first to build all binaries.

### "OpenGL not found"

Install MSYS2 with freeglut:
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-freeglut
```

### "Child processes not spawning"

The orchestrator uses `_spawnl(_P_DETACH)` on Windows to spawn child processes. Check Task Manager to verify they're running.

## Architecture Notes

### Linux vs Windows Process Spawning

| Linux | Windows |
|-------|---------|
| `fork()` + `exec()` | `_spawnl(_P_DETACH)` |
| Child inherits cwd | Must `_chdir()` before spawn |
| Easy I/O redirect | Hard (requires handles) |

### File-Based IPC

All communication happens via files:
- `pieces/keyboard/history.txt` - Input events
- `pieces/display/current_frame.txt` - Rendered frame
- `pieces/master_ledger/master_ledger.txt` - System audit log
- `pieces/apps/*/history.txt` - Per-app input

This is the **True Piece Method (TPM)** - "If it's not in a file, it's a lie."
